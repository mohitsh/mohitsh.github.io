### CHORONZON AND MORPHEUS
<p>
CHORONZON: <q> I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler. </q><br>
MORPHEUS: <q> I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing. </q><br>
CHORONZON: <q> I am Anti-Life, the Beast of Judgment. I am the dark at the end
of everythig. The end of universe, gods, worlds... of everything. Sss. And what will
you be then, <em>Dreamlord?</em></q><br>
MORPHEUS: <q>I am hope.</q><br>
