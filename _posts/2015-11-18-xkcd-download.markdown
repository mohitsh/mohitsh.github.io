On one fine weekend, I decided to combine Python and xkcd in my own way.
(they are already pretty close. try `import python` in your python shell)
I sat down and came up with this.
They are two versions of the same code. All the requirements and details 
are mentioned in the readme file.
Once done, you'll fine all of xkcd on your local system.
